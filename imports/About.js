        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Preferred Title & Escrow, Inc. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Maryland. The principals formed a title company in March 1990, which was named Phoenix Settlement Services. Unfortunately this name was similar to the name of a real estate investment company in the area. In order to avoid confusion, the name was changed, and in October of 1992, Preferred Title & Escrow, Inc. became a corporation, the principals of the company have not changed since the formation in 1990.</p>
